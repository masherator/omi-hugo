My trip to the Omi Oriental Grocery this morning was a wonderful trip. The grocery store was
spotless and very clean. Â The store is well stocked with many ingredients for great cooking.
The pricing was very reasonable and one stop shopping

The owner was extremely informative and also recommended using their supply of fresh herbs on hand.
If we have oriental cooking enthusiast please make the trip to the Omi Oriental Grocery in Enfield, CT.  Driving is easy only a minute off of I-91.   

At this time I'm already preparing list for my next trip to Enfield, CT.
