+++

Was so happy to hear this place moved closer to me from Springfield! They had a rough go with permits before they could open, but they're slowly setting up more and more over time. I'm most happy to have a kimchi fix nearby. They offer radish and cabbage kimchi of various sizes (i think a couple of them may be homemade). All the basic things you need to cook with or snack on. (Real) sushi rice, kewpie mayonnaise, all the hot sauces you want, rice flour, vietnamese rice wrappers, fresh udon or dry ones, fermented soybean paste, miso, gochujang sauce, soy sauce, ramen, tofu, etc.

My only wish is that they would stock up on more fruits/veggies. They have the awesome Asian sweet potato and napa cabbage, but that's it. I'm sure if people knew they could get more interesting greens and veggies like bok choy, potatoes, korean peppers, korean squash, shiitake mushrooms, as well as the usual scallions, onions, they'd frequent it more. That was one of my biggest reasons why I preferred going to Asian groceries: the veggies were more than just spinach and iceberg lettuce and carrots. I loved the variety I could buy. I'd love to see perilla leaves, and marinated soybean sprouts, but maybe all this is something that won't be as appreciated in the area and not worth to keep them in fresh stock. So this place is good for some basics plus some; but unfortunately I'll still have to trek to W. Hartford's A Dong Supermarket for the fruits/veggies.  

Definitely check out the ice cream freezer and get some delicious fruit bars (Melona is a good brand.. the mango and honeydew is my favorite). Also, you can get packs of 4 (or 5?) of the Nongshim ramen. And the tteok rice cakes to add to soups is always a plus. Prices are pretty reasonable; not rock bottom cheap but also not crazy expensive.

**UPDATE: 12/30/15**

FYI: I've returned and they have been stocking some more veggies! Asian sweet potatoes, Asian eggplant, scallions, hot chili peppers, etc. Some days the veggies look better than other days, but on the most part, usually pretty good.
