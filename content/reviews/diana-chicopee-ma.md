This store is great! They are small, but considering their size, they have a great variety. The owners were extremely kind & welcoming. I recently decided I would cook more Japanese dishes for the health benefits. I walked in with a LONG list & the owner was kind enough to walk me through the store & recommend brands. They kept up a friendly conversation & even helped me carry my bags to my car! I didn't even ask, but because I had my infant with me they offered. I had a wonderful experience & would love to see this business grow.
