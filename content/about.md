# About Us

<p class="lead">Welcome to the OMI ('Oh-Me') website, the 'Five Flavors' Oriental Grocery!</p>

Whether you’ve been preparing Far Eastern dishes all your life, or you want to try to making your favorite Oriental dish
for the first time, we will be delighted to help you.

We carry an ever widening variety of Asian food products that can be used in making dishes from several different cultures,
as well as cooking ware, imported dishware, teas and oriental herbal medicines, and gift items. We accompany it with
friendly service, informed knowledgeable answers, and exceptional customer service in a warm, relaxed and comfortable
environment.

As people are becoming better informed about the effect of food choices and food preparation methods and how they relate
to their long-term health, many are turning to traditional Asian cooking methods that use far more vegetables while still
providing a delicious meal.

For those of you who might feel a little lost when you go into a oriental grocery, we can understand how you feel. You want
to try making something new, but you don’t know the language on the package or are unfamiliar with the product or how
to prepare it. Just ask us. We are here to help you find what you need.
